Short Description:
===================
This iSig TC simulates an MFC (triggered due to unreachability of 
the callSubscriber() as  B-Party) of 1s duration released 
by the A-Party.


Flow detailes:
===============
- After session initiation and call establishment (answer of C-Party) the 
  TC waits 1s to simulate the ongoing chat. 
- Then the TC reports to IN that the A-Party released the call 
- This is (or should be) responded by IN with a final release 
  meaning that the MFC leg is finished.
