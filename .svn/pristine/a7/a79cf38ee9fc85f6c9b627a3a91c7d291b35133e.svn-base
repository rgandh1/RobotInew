Short Description:
===================
This iSig TC simulates a MOC establishment attempt that is canceled
by the callSubscriber() (=A-Party) after 20s.

Flow details:
==============
- After session initiation the TC waits 20s to simulate waiting for the 
  B-Party to answer.
- Then the TC reports "abandon" to IN meaning that the A-Party is no 
  longer willing to wait for the B-Party to answer.
- This is (or should be) responded by IN with a final continueProcessing 
  meaning that the MOC leg is finished and HLR is responsible to decide 
  how to resume. 

Parameters: 
============
  mscAddress         of the A-Party (callSubscriber()) 
  mocBPartyMsisdn
