Short Description:
This iSig TC simulates a standard MOC of 76s duration 
charged in 2 slices (60s + 16s) and released by the
A-Party (i.e. callSubscriber()).

Flow details:
- After session initiation and call establishment (answer) the 
  TC waits 60s to simulate the first slice of the ongoing chat.
- Then the TC reports to IN that 60s have been elapsed 
- This is (or should be) responded by IN with a superviseReq 
  for a further 60s slice 
- TC waits additional 16s to simulate the 2nd slice of the 
  ongoing chat ...
- ... and finally reports to IN that the A-Party released the call 
- This is (or should be) responded by IN with a final release 
  meaning that the MOC leg is finished. 

Parameters: 
  mscAddress         of the A-Party (callSubscriber())
