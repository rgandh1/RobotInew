CRM_Misc_002 - Change Ticket Status
    [Documentation]    To change the state, it is neccessary to use the command "Focus" to focus on the button.
    ...    If we don't use that command, the Webdriver only scrolls down until half of the button is seen, because of the iframe. But then Selenium will not press the button and gives back an errormessage (Element cannot be scrolled into view).
