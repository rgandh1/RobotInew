Short Description:
This iSig TC simulates a standard MOC of 5min 16s duration 
charged in 6 slices (5*60s + 16s) and released by the
A-Party (i.e. callSubscriber()).

Flow details:
1. After session initiation and call establishment (answer) the 
   TC waits 60s to simulate the first slice of the ongoing chat.
2. Then the TC reports to IN that 60s have been elapsed 
3. This is (or should be) responded by IN with a superviseReq 
   for a further 60s slice 
4. TC waits additional 60s to simulate the 2nd slice of the ongoing chat  
   and then reports to IN that further 60s have been elapsed 
5. This is (or should be) responded by IN with a superviseReq 
   for a further 60s slice   
6. Step 4. and 5. are repeated for the 3rd, 4th and 5th slice 
7. TC waits additional 16s to simulate the 6th slice of the 
   ongoing chat ...
8. ... and finally reports to IN that the A-Party released the call 
9. This is (or should be) responded by IN with a final release 
   meaning that the MOC leg is finished. 

Parameters: 
  mscAddress         of the A-Party (callSubscriber())
