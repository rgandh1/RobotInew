Documentation     This robot resource file provides standard variables that describe
...               the environment of the TNZ testbed.
...               Testsuites should never hardcode these infos but instead should
...               include this resourcefile. In case that the testbed configuration
...               changes this central resource file enables simplest adaptation of
...               all related testsuites.
