** Settings ***
Documentation     This robot resource file provides standard variables that describe
...               the software environment of the robot workspace.
... 
...               Testsuites should never hardcode these infos but instead should 
...               include this resourcefile. In case that the applications are moved 
...               to another place or get a new foldername (e.g when using newer versions)
...               this central resource file enables simplest adaptation of 
...               all testsuites.
...
...               ATTENTION: Please don't mess up this file by creating additional
...               variables in advance as long as you don't really use them in any
...               testsuite.
