# This bash script is the pendant to robotworkspace-resource.txt
# and provides standard variables that describe the software 
# environment of the robot workspace to be included in robot 
# testsuite execution scripts.
#
# Bash scripts for testuite execution should never hardcode these
# infos but instead should include this file (via "source" command). 
# In case that the applications are moved to another place or get 
# a new foldername (e.g when using newer versions) this central 
# bash include file enables simplest adaptation of all testsuite
# execution scripts.
#
# ATTENTION: Please don't mess up this file by creating additional
# variables in advance as long as you don't really use them in any
# testsuite execution script.
