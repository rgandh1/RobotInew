This table documents the agreed robotframework test suite tags that may be assigned by a test suite author.
To describe the semantic of each tag and the rules how it is allowed to be combined with other tags, the table below groups the tags to different aspects (Groups/AttributeSets).

Multiplicity:         Defines whether maultiple tags out of a group are allowed to be simultaneously assigned to a suite (inclusive) or maximal one (exclusive) and if at least one is mandatory
Missing-Tag Semantic: Defines whether the absence of a tag in a test suite implicitely assignes his opposit meaning (e.g. MOC Service involved / MOC Service NOT involved) to the test suite or simply is interpreted as beeing undefined in this resspect (e.g. MOC Service involved / unknown whethter or not MOC Service is involved).
Contradicting Groups: The tags of some groups may contradict the tags of other groups and therefore a combination of the 2 groups is not allowed.
Folder Tags:          Tags can be assigned at folder level (meaning the tags are inherited to all subsequent test suites) or directly at test suite level. 
                      To avoid contradiction or ambiguity most of the tags are dedicated either to folder level or to test suite level.

To unify the naming convention of project related tags (SupportedProjects, ProjectDedications, ...) we also need an agreement on a set of unique shortcuts used for tag prefixing.
