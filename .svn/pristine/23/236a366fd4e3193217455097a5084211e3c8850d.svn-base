This following 2 files of this folder make up the soapUI project:
=================================================================

1) TNZ-WS-PerformanceTests-soapui-project.xml

   is the SoapUI project file containing 
   - a testcase with 8 web service requests and
   - a corresponding loadt test that executes the TC for each line of the subscriber.csv 


2) subscribers.csv 

   contains the subscribers used by the soapUI load test


For more details open the project and have a look at its Description property.


Prerequisites
=============

Please ensure that your ~/soapui-settings.xml has switched the groovy logs on for loadtests if you won't supress their script's log entries.
This is done vis soapUI's menu <File><Preferences><UI settings><Do not disable the groovy log when running load tests>
