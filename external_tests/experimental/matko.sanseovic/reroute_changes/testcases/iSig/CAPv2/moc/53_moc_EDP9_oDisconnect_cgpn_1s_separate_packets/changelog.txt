Short Description:
===================
This iSig TC simulates a standard MOC of 1s duration released 
by the A-Party (i.e. callSubscriber()).

Flow details:
==============
- After session initiation and call establishment (answer) the 
  TC waits 1s to simulate the ongoing chat. 
- Then the TC reports to IN that the A-Party released the call 
- This is (or should be) responded by IN with a final release 
  meaning that the MOC leg is finished. 

Parameters: 
============
  mscAddress         of the A-Party (callSubscriber()) 
  mocBPartyMsisdn
