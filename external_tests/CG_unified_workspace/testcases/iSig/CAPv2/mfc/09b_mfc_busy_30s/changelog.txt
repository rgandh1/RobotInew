Short Description:
===================
This iSig TC simulates an MFC leg (triggered due to unreachability of 
the callSubscriber() as  B-Party) whose call establishement even fails
due to unreachability of the C-Party.
The TC was originally called 09b_mfc_missed_call_notification_FTN_continue_to_IVR
but now renamed since the original name implied restrictions that are not
really part of the TCs flow.

Flow detailes:
===============
- After session initiation the TC waits 30s to simulate waiting for the 
  C-Party to answer.
- Then the TC reports "busy" to IN meaning that the C-Party is not reachable 
  too.
- This is (or should be) responded by IN with a final continueProcessing 
  meaning that the MFC leg is finished and HLR is responsible to decide 
  how to resume (e.g. redirect to IVR or to probably configured alternate 
  C-Party(s)). 

Parameters: 
============
  mscAddress         of the B-Party (callSubscriber()) 
  gmscAddress        of the B-Party (callSubscriber())
