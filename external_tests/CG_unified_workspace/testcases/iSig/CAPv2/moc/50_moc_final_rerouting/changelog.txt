Short Description:
===================
This iSig TC simulates a MOC initialization that is
redirected to any other number without further tracking (charging) the call 
e.g. - charge-free (toll-free) number
     - redirection to IVR due to forbidden number or insufficient initial funds, ... 


Flow details:
==============

answered by IN with a reRoute stating that moreEventsExpected=0
- i.e. the call is ongoing but from IN perspective the session 
is finished (call is no further tracked).
