Short Description:
===================
This iSig TC simulates a MOC initialization that is canceled 
due to NoAnswer event reported to IN


Flow detailes:
===============
- After session initiation the TC waits 1s to simulate waiting for the 
  B-Party to answer. 
  NOTICE that although IN sets the noAnswerTimer to 3min 
  the TC waits here only for 1sec to reduce TC execution time.
  Thus this TC is usable only for functional testing NOT for load testing
- Then the TC reports "NoAnswer" to IN meaning that the B-Party didn't accept the call 
- This is (or should be) responded by IN with a final continueProcessing 
  meaning that the MOC leg is finished and HLR is responsible to decide 
  how to resume (e.g. redirect to IVR or to probably configured C-Party).
