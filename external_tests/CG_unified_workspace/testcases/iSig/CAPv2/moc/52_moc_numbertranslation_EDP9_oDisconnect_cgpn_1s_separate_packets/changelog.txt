Short Description:
===================
This iSig TC simulates a MOC of 1s duration to a virtual number
(configured in IN's number translation feature) and that is
released  by the A-Party (i.e. callSubscriber()).

Flow details:
==============
1. The session initiation request with the virtual number as mocBPartyMsisdn
   is (or should be) acknowledged by IN with a <routeReq> to the translated MSISDN 
   instead of a normal <continue>
2. After call establishment (answer) the TC waits 5s to simulate 
   the ongoing chat. 
3. Then the TC reports to IN that the A-Party released the call 
   This is (or should be) responded by IN with a final release 
   meaning that the MOC leg is finished. 

Parameters: 
============
  mscAddress                 of the A-Party (callSubscriber()) 
  mocBPartyMsisdn            the virtual number used as B-Party
  mocBPartyMsisdnTranslated  the real B-Party MSISDN rerouted to by IN
