Short Description:
===================
This iSig TC simulates a roaming MTC of 133s duration (charged in 3 
slices: 2*60s+13s) to the callSubscriber() (as B-Party) being in a 
foreign location and released by the A-Party.

Flow details:
==============
- After session initiation and call establishment (answer) the 
  TC waits 60s to simulate the first slice of the ongoing chat.
- Then the TC reports to IN that 60s have been elapsed 
- This is (or should be) responded by IN with a superviseReq 
  for a further 60s slice 
- TC waits additional 60s to simulate the 2nd slice of the ongoing chat  
  and then reports to IN that further 60s have been elapsed 
- This is (or should be) responded by IN with a superviseReq 
  for a further 60s slice   
- TC waits additional 13s to simulate the 3rd slice of the 
  ongoing chat ...
- ... and finally reports to IN that the A-Party released the call 
- This is (or should be) responded by IN with a final release 
  meaning that the MTC leg is finished.
