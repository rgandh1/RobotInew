Short Description:
===================
This iSig TC simulates a roaming MTC establishment attempt (to
the callSubscriber() (=A-Party) being in a foreign location) that 
is canceled by the A-Party after 10s.

Flow details:
==============
- After session initiation the TC waits 20s to simulate waiting for the 
  callSubscriber() to answer.
- Then the TC reports "abandon" to IN meaning that the A-Party is no 
  longer willing to wait for the B-Party to answer.
- This is (or should be) responded by IN with a final continueProcessing 
  meaning that the MTC leg is finished and HLR is responsible to decide 
  how to resume. 

Parameters: 
============
  mscAddress         of the B-Party (callSubscriber()) 
  roamingVlrAddress  of the B-Party's current (foreign) location
  mtcAPartyMsisdn
